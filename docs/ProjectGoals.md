# Project Goals

## Overview

**Infinity** is an interactive 3D website designed to archive and showcase travel memories in a creative, immersive format. The project merges 3D WebGL scenes with traditional 2D DOM elements to create a unique hybrid experience.

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Create an Immersive Memory Archive
- Build a digital scrapbook that feels personal and nostalgic
- Use visual metaphors (a physical book) to represent memory collection
- Design an experience that evokes the feeling of flipping through old photographs

### 2. Seamless 3D/2D Integration
- Implement smooth transitions between WebGL canvas and DOM elements
- Ensure the experience feels cohesive rather than disjointed
- Maintain performance across the transition

### 3. Beautiful Visual Design
- Apply a warm, vintage-inspired color palette (sepia, parchment, gold)
- Use atmospheric lighting to create "memory" ambiance
- Add subtle animations that enhance without overwhelming

## Technical Goals

### Performance
- Lightweight 3D scene (procedural geometry, no heavy models)
- Optimized animations with GPU acceleration
- Lazy loading for memory images

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

### Responsive Design
- Full functionality on desktop and mobile
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

## User Experience Goals

1. **First Impression**: User sees an elegant 3D book on a desk
2. **Discovery**: User can orbit/explore the book from limited angles
3. **Engagement**: Clicking the book reveals the memory collection
4. **Exploration**: Scrolling through memories feels like wandering
5. **Delight**: Subtle animations and transitions create joy

## Success Metrics

- Smooth 60fps animations throughout
- Page load time under 3 seconds
- Intuitive navigation (no instructions needed)
- Visually distinctive (not "generic AI" aesthetic)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] User-uploadable memories (backend integration)
- [ ] Timeline view with date filtering
- [ ] Map view showing travel locations
- [ ] Export/share functionality
- [ ] Sound design (ambient audio)
